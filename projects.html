                            In my independent research at Kyoto University Hospital, I uncovered a novel tumor
                            suppressive mechanism in B-lymphomas: internal CXCL13 expression leads to CXCR5 receptor
                            internalization, disrupting essential germinal center migration and triggering lymphoma
                            apoptosis. This intrinsic pathway, driven by a distal super-enhancer on the CCNG2 locus,
                            reveals a previously unknown mechanism of natural B-lymphoma suppression.
                            Further, I demonstrated that aberrant CXCL13-CXCR5 signaling in solid tumors (e.g., HCT116,
                            HepG2) enhances expression of cell cycle regulators (PTP4A1), metastatic receptors (CCR7),
                            and ubiquitin ligases involved in the p53 degradation, contributing to drug resistance via
                            p53 dysregulation.
                            This approach led to the identification of CCR7, PTP4A1, and p53-specific ubiquitin ligases
                            as novel therapeutic targets, particularly in the context of CXCL13 and co-expressed CXCR5
                            signaling.

                            Title: Epigenetic Regulation and Chromosome Conformation in Meiotic DNA Double-Strand Break
                            Formation and Repair
                            Institution: Osaka University, Japan
                            During my doctoral studies at Osaka University, I developed a strong foundation in
                            chromosome biology, with a particular focus on the molecular mechanisms underlying DNA
                            double-strand break (DSB) formation and repair during meiosis. Using the budding yeast
                            meiosis system as a model, I investigated how chromatin structure and transcriptional
                            activity influence meiotic recombination events.
                            My research specifically addressed the complex interplay among epigenetic regulators,
                            cohesin complexes, and the transcriptional machinery, which together modulate meiotic
                            chromosome conformation into loop-axis domains. I identified the RNA polymerase II
                            elongation complex Paf1C as a key player in orchestrating histone modifications—such as
                            H2BK123 ubiquitination and H3K4, H3K36, and H3K79 trimethylation—that are critical for
                            chromatin organization. Importantly, I demonstrated that Paf1C regulates the distribution of
                            programmed DSBs by promoting Spo11-dependent DSB formation at meiotic recombination hotspots
                            and suppressing it at cold spots (Gothwal et al., Genetics, 2016). This regulatory mechanism
                            contributes to the fidelity of genome inheritance, preventing chromosomal mis-segregation,
                            aneuploidy, and genome instability.
                            These findings provide novel insights into the molecular basis of DSB patterning and its
                            implications for genetic integrity. The broader relevance of my work ties to chromosomal
                            disorders such as Down syndrome and Klinefelter syndrome, which result from improper
                            chromosome segregation and abnormal meiosis. This research laid a conceptual foundation for
                            understanding how epigenetic and transcriptional regulation ensure safe genome transmission
                            and drive evolutionary processes. In context of cancer biology, the mammalian homologue of
                            Paf1C and Set1 methyltransferase are highly expressed in human cancer, particularly MLL1
                            fusions are frequent in childhood leukemia, and solid cancers. These studies led my interest
                            in the cancer chemotherapeutic target development for the human cancers exhibit aberrant
                            expression of these chromatin factors, Paf1C and Histone lysine4 methyltransferase. In
                            continuation of this, I am currently involved in analyzing the role of WDR5, a member of
                            MLL1 family proteins in humans, which is highly expressed in human glioblastoma and several
                            other solid cancers. The axis of chemotherapeutic resistance and tumorigenesis by these
                            chromatin factors is driven by excessive transcription leading to oncogenic signaling but
                            also the proteasomal regulation of high-fidelity DNA-repair factors, particularly the
                            Homologous recombination. These attempts are giving a hope and optimistic path for the
                            design of sensitive chemotherapies specific to the histone methyltransferase overexpressing
                            tumors.

                            Postdoctoral Training: Chromosome Translocations and B-Lymphomagenesis
                            Mentor: Prof. Tasuku Honjo, Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine (2018)
                            Institution: Kyoto University, Japan
                            During my postdoctoral training with Prof. Tasuku Honjo, I expanded my research into
                            site-specific recombination in B cells, focusing on the mechanisms by which
                            Activation-Induced Cytidine Deaminase (AID) induces DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) at the
                            immunoglobulin (Ig) locus during class switch recombination (CSR). This process is essential
                            for antibody diversity but carries inherent risks of chromosomal translocations and genomic
                            instability.
                            My work centered on understanding how the histone acetyl-reader protein BRD2 regulates the
                            repair of AID-induced DSBs. I demonstrated that BRD2 promotes non-homologous end joining
                            (NHEJ) while suppressing homologous recombination (HR) and microhomology-mediated end
                            joining (MMEJ), thereby directing repair toward the predominant pathway used during CSR
                            (Gothwal et al., 2024, Nucleic Acids Research). Mechanistically, BRD2 coordinates DSB repair
                            by recruiting cohesin loaders (NIPBL), CTCF, and other structural regulators to the Ig
                            locus, ensuring efficient NHEJ. However, this same mechanism also facilitates pathogenic
                            IgH–MYC translocations, contributing to B-lymphomagenesis.
                            This work provided new insights into how BRD2, together with chromosome structural proteins
                            like NIPBL, maintains genome integrity during antibody diversification while revealing its
                            dual role in promoting oncogenic translocations. Intriguingly, NIPBL mutations—known to
                            cause Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS)—may also impair humoral immune responses, suggesting
                            broader links between chromatin structure, immunity, and disease.
                            While BRD2 aids physiological CSR, our findings also revealed its contribution to
                            AID-induced IgH–MYC translocations, indicating that bromodomain proteins may act as
                            oncogenic drivers in B cells. However, the elimination of B cells bearing non-functional or
                            oncogenic B cell receptors (e.g., from translocations) points to additional tumor suppressor
                            mechanisms active during germinal center (GC) reactions. In subsequent projects, I began
                            exploring how these intrinsic checkpoints restrict affinity maturation and prevent GC exit
                            of potentially malignant clones.
                            Beyond their biological roles, bromodomain proteins like BRD2 are also therapeutic targets.
                            Small molecule inhibitors such as JQ1 have shown potential in suppressing oncogene
                            expression driven by BRD proteins. Collectively, these findings underscore BRD2’s
                            significance both in genome maintenance and as a promising target in B cell malignancies.

                            The germinal center (GC) reaction is a central process in the humoral immune response,
                            enabling B cells to undergo somatic hypermutation and antibody class switching, ultimately
                            producing high-affinity antibodies. Upon antigenic stimulation, GC B cells upregulate two
                            key regulators: BCL6, which promotes B cell survival, and activation-induced cytidine
                            deaminase (AID), which introduces DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) to facilitate antibody
                            diversification.

                            While AID activity is crucial for immune adaptation, it also poses a significant risk:
                            off-target DNA damage can result in chromosomal translocations, such as IgH-MYC and
                            IgH-BCL6, which are hallmarks of Burkitt’s lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
                            (DLBCL). Despite the lifelong activation of GC responses in the human body, these lymphomas
                            are relatively rare, suggesting the existence of intrinsic quality control mechanisms that
                            eliminate potentially malignant B cells before they differentiate into plasma or memory
                            cells.

                        <p>
                            I hypothesized that the GC microenvironment has the ability to spontaneously eliminate
                            B-cell lymphomas arising from AID-induced genomic instability.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To investigate this, I used the Raji cell line—a human Burkitt’s lymphoma model—and exposed
                            it to 4 mM hydroxyurea (HU) to simulate DNA replication stress similar to that experienced
                            during GC reactions. I then performed single-cell RNA sequencing and chromatin
                            immunoprecipitation (ChIP) targeting H3K4me3, a histone mark associated with
                            transcriptionally active promoters.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This approach allowed me to identify genes with altered expression under genotoxic stress,
                            potentially mimicking how GC-derived B-lymphomas respond to physiological checkpoints. Among
                            several novel candidates, I identified MBD1 (methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 1), which
                            plays a role in promoting cell survival during DNA replication stress. In addition, I
                            observed alterations in gene families including zinc finger transcription factors, E2/E3
                            ubiquitin ligases, DNA repair genes, and G-protein-coupled receptors.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            These findings suggest that GC B cells may possess an innate tumor-suppressive program that
                            can detect and eliminate aberrant clones through stress-induced transcriptional and
                            epigenetic remodeling.

                            Impact:
                            This work uncovers potential novel mechanisms for the elimination of pre-malignant B cells
                            within the GC and highlights new therapeutic targets not only for hematological malignancies
                            but possibly for solid tumors as well. Further functional characterization of these gene
                            candidates could open new avenues in the development of stress-based targeted therapies.

                            Identification of MBD1 as a novel therapeutic target (Kanazawa University as an independent
                            researcher)- I developed a unique approach using Raji cells to screen novel tumor
                            suppression mechanisms. Raji is a germinal center (GC) derived-B-lymphoma. The GC-derived
                            B-lymphomas are naturally suppressed in GCs, thus they could be informative on tumor
                            suppressor mechanism if induced with genotoxic-stress, similar to B cells experience in GC
                            microenvironment. I treated Raji with Hydroxyurea (HU), simulating a genotoxic stress as
                            faced by GC B cells i.e. DNA-replication stress. Among several induced genes in HU-induced
                            genotoxic stress in Raji cells MBD1, a gene encoding for DNA-CpG methylation-binding protein
                            was induced. Functional analysis revealed that MBD1 suppresses genomic instabilities at the
                            BCL6 locus, preventing BCL6 rearrangements. BCL6-translocations are observed in 31% of
                            diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and other cancers (Gothwal et al., 2024, In
                            Preparation). MBD1 also inhibits IRF4 and PRDM1, key regulators of plasma B cell
                            differentiation, suggesting its role in suppressing multiple myeloma (a plasma B cell
                            malignancy). Furthermore, MBD1 depletion sensitized Raji cells to HU, gemcitabine, and
                            etoposide, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in cancers resistant to DNA
                            replication inhibitors.

                            et al., 2024). Under genotoxic stress, MBD1 suppresses BCL6 expression in B cells,
                            potentially limiting BCL6-dependent lymphomagenesis in GCs. In parallel, MBD1 fine-tunes
                            IRF4 regulation to support proper plasma cell differentiation, ensuring the fidelity and
                            functional quality of the GC response.
