                    Chemotherapeutic treatment of cancers is influenced by DNA mutations in cancer cells.
                    Mutations in genes can disrupt cellular pathways and affect treatment outcomes.
                    Approved chemotherapeutic agents mostly belong to DNA replication inhibitors (Gemcitabine,
                    Hydroxyurea),
                    DNA repair inhibitors (DNA-PKs, NHEJ/HR inhibitors), or modulators of histone modifications
                    triggered by the DNA damage response. If understood well the nature of these DNA- mutation
                    and their context with cellular responses induced by approved, chemotherapeutic drugs,
                    this is quite possible to develop target therapies with best sensitivity and safer outcomes,
                    nullifying the existing roadblock in the safety concerns of the existing chemotherapeutics.

                    Effective chemotherapeutic response can be fluctuated by intrinsic gain- and loss-of-function
                    alterations in cancer cells to DNA mutations. For instance the mutation in TP53, a key tumor
                    suppressor and most mutated in human cancers, can lead to chemotherapeutic resistance. Also,
                    excessive single-strand DNA formation may enhance homologous recombination (HR), leading to
                    resistance against Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, which are approved for
                    BRCA1/2-mutant breast cancers.

                <p class="mb-6">
                    Additionally, variations in DNA repair factors—spanning HR, non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), and
                    DNA replication machinery—can drive drug resistance through mechanisms such as excessive DNA repair
                    via alternative pathways, R-loop formation, elevated oncogene expression, reduced apoptotic
                    activity, altered E2/E3 ligase function, and modified metastatic receptor expression. These factors
                    collectively undermine the efficacy of chemotherapeutic targets.

                    Current chemotherapy regimens for several cancers including of the lung cancer, breast cancer, and
                    cholangiocarcinoma often rely on non-specific agents like gemcitabine and etoposide, lacking
                    tailored precision. In contrast, personalized cancer medicine, including selective immunotherapies,
                    represents the future of effective cancer treatment.

                <p>
                    The long-term objective is to develop systems that classify cancer mutations in individual patients
                    and evaluate optimal chemotherapeutic drug combinations before the initial regimen is prescribed by
                    oncologists. This approach aims to enhance decision-making for drug selection, improve patient life
                    expectancy, and minimize damage to healthy tissues, which is often a consequence of conventional
                    chemotherapies. Research efforts are dedicated to advancing this vision of precision oncology.
